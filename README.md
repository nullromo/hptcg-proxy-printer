# HPTCG Proxy Printer

Use [the deployed site](TODO) to print out proxy cards for the Harry Potter
Trading Card Game.

## About the Game

Harry Potter TCG was published by Wizards of the Coast from 2001 to 2003. They
released 5 sets of cards. Starting in 2020, the HPTCG revival community has
created new expansion sets to keep the game alive.

### Card database: [Accio.cards](https://accio.cards/)

Here, you can search for cards and find all the original and revival cards.
Take a look at the "Syntax" tab to find more information about how to use the
search tool.

### Community website:

[hptcgrevival](https://hptcgrevival.github.io/hptcgrevival/)

This site has a lot of good resources, like the official game rules, banlist,
event schedule, and decklists from past events.

### Community [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/EKJSXBC)

This is a good place to discuss everything about the game and ask questions if
you are new.
