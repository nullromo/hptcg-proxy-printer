## 🐦‍🔥 About HPTCG Proxy Printer

### 🧹 Instructions

To use the site, simply type or paste in a list of cards you want to print. Then
click the "Go!" button to preview the card images. Finally, click the "Download"
button to download a PDF with all the card images.

It is recommended to print the cards on plain white paper, then slide them into
a card sleeve along with a normal card. The cards are 63mm x 88mm, which is a
standard size for cards. Most card sleeves will fit this standard size. For the
normal card, you can use HPTCG cards if you have them, but cards from other
games like Magic, Netrunner, or YuGiOh will also work too. Standard playing
cards should work as well.
